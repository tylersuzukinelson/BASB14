# Week 2 - Top Obsidian Resources for Organize

## TLDR

The goal of this week isn't to emulate the PARA system of Tiago or any of the mentors. The best thing to do is start with a 4-folder PARA system and only add complexity when you need it. Remember to keep your eye set on why you decided to enroll in [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com).

## Approaches to PARA

### Folder-based

- Convergence / Top-down
- Easier to understand
- Notes can only live in one place
- [Example with nested resources](https://github.com/tylersuzukinelson/BASB14/tree/main/Examples%20of%20PARA%20structures/Folder-based/Nested%20resources%20(area-first%20approach%20via%20Bob%20Doto))
- [Example with standard PARA](https://github.com/tylersuzukinelson/BASB14/tree/main/Examples%20of%20PARA%20structures/Folder-based/Standard)

### Link-based

- Divergence / Bottom-up
- Notes can live in multiple places
- Easier to lose track of things
- [Example](https://github.com/tylersuzukinelson/BASB14/tree/main/Examples%20of%20PARA%20structures/Link-based)

### Tag-based

- Divergence / Bottom-up
- Notes can live in multiple places
- Easier to lose track of things

## Obsidian tips

- Don't be afraid to copy and paste things. Plugins can help speed things up, but they can also hold you back. Leaning to heavily on plugins can lead to overlooking solutions that are right in front of you. Also, this additional friction is sometimes useful in reflecting on whether something is really worth capturing.
- If you need to focus, [vaults (or sub-vaults)](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault) may be useful. This can enhance convergence on your goal at the cost of bottom-up thinking.
- The [Workspaces](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Workspaces) plugin offers a quick way to set-up your Obsidian for a specific mind-set or task.
- It's possible to [embed search results](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search#Embed+search+results) in a note. These searches may include those for certain tags, incomplete todos, or highlighted text.
- Whether your prefer to keep your media (e.g. images) attachments in a media folder or in the folder with your note, you can change the [default attachment location](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Manage+attachments#Change+default+attachment+location) in the Obsidian settings.

## Quotes

> The [Gene Kelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGvV7FEv-pQ) Rule: Being familiar with your environment is better than having the perfect environment.

> [!QUOTE] David Allen
> You don't actually do a project; you can only do action steps related to it. When enough of the right action steps have been taken, some situation will have been created that matches your initial picture of the outcome closely enough that you can call it "done."

> [!QUOTE] Father Quintana, [_To the Wonder_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1595656)
> The man who makes a mistake can repent. But the man who hesitates, who does nothing, who buries his talent in the earth--with him, he can do nothing.

> [!QUOTE] [Tiago Forte](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1512056870902681605)
> Only start projects that are already 80% done.

## Miscellaneous

- When you're able to trust your PARA system, it frees your brain to focus on the truly important things.
- As you're first getting started, and especially if you're feeling at all paralyzed or confused, stick with adding the basic PARA structure. Only add additional complexity when you realize you need it.
- When it comes to distinguishing the different components of PARA, here are a few useful questions to consider:
    - What does done look like?
    - What is the deadline?
    - What standard is being maintained?
- Here are two additional models that may be useful for defining a project:
    - [Jobs to be done](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/jobs-to-be-done-a-framework-for-customer-needs-c883cbf61c90)
    - [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
- An additional model that may be useful for defining an area is [roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role) (e.g. parent, spouse, student).
- An area-first perspective of PARA may be useful to frame the context for information and projects. Through this lens, information or projects that make it into your system will be related to one of your areas.
    - Another perspective on areas: an area is an aspect of our life that requires maintenance, enhancement, or redirection. In an area-first perspective, projects are used to maintain, enhance, or redirect areas.
- Inboxes can be used to gather notes that need to be processed. However, people may gather different things into their inbox. It may be useful to capture everything in your inbox. It may also be useful to capture only things related to active projects in your inbox.
- It may be helpful to keep a log note for your projects that has date-stamped entries regarding your progress.
- Daily notes can be archived if they're cluttering up your vault. Depending on your tolerance for the build-up of daily notes, you can add your daily notes to a `2022`, `April`/`2022M04`, or `2022W17` folder and then move them to the archive.
